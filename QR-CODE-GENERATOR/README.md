``` QR CODE GENERATOR```

##### In this project, I have added a simple code to generate QR code image and save in the file using qrcode npm package.

##### I'm saving the QR code in a file using fs module.

##### You can generate QR code for all kinds of data, here I have used both text and url for generating the QR code image.

##### Attached QR code Screenshot, also you can find in the repository.
