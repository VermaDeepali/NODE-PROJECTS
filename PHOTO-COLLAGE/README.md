``` PHOTO COLLAGE```

##### In this project, I have added a simple code to collage image from given photos and save in the file using nf-photo-collage npm package.

##### I'm saving the newly created collage in a file using fs module.

##### You can generate collage for various sources, here I have only used images to create collage.

##### Attached COLLAGE Screenshot, also you can find in the repository.
